A legal destination puts the player in a position to attempt an interception, an empty square that is the target of the pass, or with his tackle zone on the thrower or catcher.

These extra players may not be placed on the Line of Scrimmage or in a Wide Zone. Swarming players must be set up in their team\u2019s half.When using Swarming, a coach may not set up more players with the Swarming trait onto the pitch than the number of friendly players with the Swarming trait that were already set up. So, if a team had 2 players with the Swarming trait already set up on the pitch, and then rolled for 3 more players to enter the pitch via Swarming, only a maximum of 2 more Swarming players could be set up on the pitch."
